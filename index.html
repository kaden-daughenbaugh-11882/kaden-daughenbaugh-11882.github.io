     >> Recently Escape From Tarkov has been my favorite game, but it's quite annoying, my mouse agrees. I think Rust is a neat game and I think I like it more than Tarkov, that's why I played it for 2,700 hours. I like FPS games since I've been playing them since around 2010. I also play singleplayer games, recently, I beat two games, Firewatch and A Night In The Woods. I also like playing with my friends on games, spending time with my family, and hanging out with my bearded dragon named Taco.

      >>> I don't like games that require a long extensive playthrough, especially the same thing over and over again, a couple hours maybe even 100 hours is fine, but something like 500 is outragous *cough cough* Dying Light 2 *Cough *cough cough*. But I especially don't like the games that require multiple players to actually enjoy the time, especially when it's more players = more chance of winning. Even playing fields is fun for everyone!
      It's all fun though, I'm just happy to be able to play games.
