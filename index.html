    <h3 class="reverse">Things I enjoy</h3>
    <p>
      Recently Escape From Tarkov has been my favorite game, but it's quite annoying at times, my mouse agrees. I think Rust is a neat game and I think I like it more than Tarkov, that's why I played it for 2,700 hours. I like FPS games since I've been playing them since around 2010. I also play singleplayer games, recently, I beat two games, Firewatch and A Night In The Woods. I also like playing with my friends on games, spending time with my family, and hanging out with my bearded dragon named Taco.
